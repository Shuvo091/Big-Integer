# Big-Integer
This is a project using C++ .
The big integer is a project that enables us to use integers that exceeds thousands of digits.
it is very responsive for operations of integers with 1K-2K digits.


the key features:
                   <1>: Summation
                   <2>: Subtraction
                   <3>: Multiplication
                   <4>: Division
                   <5>: Power function
                   <6>: Modular operation
                   <7>: Factorial operation
                   <8>: Matrix operations on Big integers
